# Community Magazine Platform - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
A web platform enabling adults with learning disabilities to contribute to a community magazine through accessible interfaces, with admin moderation and public viewing capabilities.

## 1. Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Functional Requirements
- **Content Submission**: Text, images, audio recordings, drawings
- **Admin Workflow**: Review, approve/reject, edit submissions
- **Magazine Compilation**: Create versioned magazines from approved content
- **Public Access**: View published magazines via shareable links
- **Offline Support**: Printable format generation

### 1.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Performance**: Fast loading for users with varying internet speeds
- **Scalability**: Handle growing content library and user base
- **Security**: Protect user data and prevent inappropriate content
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimize operational costs for non-profit

### 1.3 User Personas
1. **Contributors**: Adults with learning disabilities submitting content
2. **Administrators**: Staff reviewing and publishing content
3. **Viewers**: Public accessing published magazines

## 2. Proposed Architecture

### 2.1 Tech Stack

#### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured data) + Cloudinary/S3 (media storage)
- **ORM**: Prisma (type-safe database access)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **API**: RESTful with potential GraphQL for complex queries

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with Next.js (for SSR/SSG and better SEO)
- **State Management**: Zustand or Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with accessibility-first approach
- **Components**: Radix UI for accessible primitives

#### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Railway (as specified)
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary (free tier) or AWS S3
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions â†’ Railway auto-deploy
- **Monitoring**: Railway metrics + Sentry for error tracking

### 2.2 Database Schema

```sql
-- Core tables
users (
  id, email, name, role, created_at
)

submissions (
  id, user_id, category, content_type, status, 
  text_content, media_url, created_at, reviewed_at
)

magazines (
  id, title, version, published_at, is_public, 
  shareable_link
)

magazine_items (
  id, magazine_id, submission_id, display_order
)

audit_log (
  id, user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, 
  timestamp, details
)
```

### 2.3 API Structure

```
/api/auth
  POST /login
  POST /logout
  POST /refresh

/api/submissions
  GET    / (paginated, filtered)
  POST   / (create new)
  GET    /:id
  PATCH  /:id/status (admin only)
  DELETE /:id

/api/magazines
  GET    / (public, paginated)
  POST   / (admin only)
  GET    /:id
  PATCH  /:id (admin only)
  GET    /:id/print (generate PDF)

/api/media
  POST   /upload (presigned URL)
  DELETE /:id
```

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up GitHub repository structure
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure Railway deployment pipeline
- Set up PostgreSQL database with Prisma
- Implement basic authentication system

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- Build submission creation API and UI
- Implement admin dashboard for content review
- Create media upload handling (images, audio)
- Add drawing canvas functionality

### Phase 3: Magazine Compilation (Week 5)
- Build magazine editor interface
- Implement drag-and-drop ordering
- Create public viewing pages
- Generate shareable links

### Phase 4: Accessibility & Polish (Week 6)
- Comprehensive accessibility audit
- Add text-to-speech functionality
- Implement high contrast modes
- Create print-friendly CSS
- PDF generation for offline viewing

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 7)
- User acceptance testing with target audience
- Performance optimization
- Security audit
- Production deployment
- Documentation and training materials

## 4. Key Design Decisions

### 4.1 Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced features for modern browsers
- Offline-first approach with service workers

### 4.2 Media Handling Strategy
- Client-side compression before upload
- Lazy loading for performance
- Multiple format support (WebP with fallbacks)
- Automatic audio transcription (stretch goal)

### 4.3 Security Measures
- Content moderation queue
- Rate limiting on submissions
- Input sanitization
- CORS properly configured
- Environment variables for secrets

### 4.4 Accessibility Strategy
- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels and live regions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader testing
- Simple language and clear instructions

## 5. Migration Strategy

### From Current HTML to Full Stack
1. **Extract Components**: Break HTML into React components
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Maintain all current features
3. **Add Backend Gradually**: Start with API endpoints
4. **Parallel Development**: Keep HTML version running during transition
5. **Data Migration**: Move localStorage data to database

## 6. Cost Considerations

### Estimated Monthly Costs
- Railway Hosting: ~$5-20/month
- PostgreSQL: Included in Railway
- Cloudinary: Free tier (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth)
- Domain: ~$12/year
- **Total**: ~$10-30/month

### Cost Optimization
- Use Railway's usage-based pricing
- Implement caching strategies
- Compress media before storage
- Archive old magazines to cold storage

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Submission success rate
- Page load times
- Error rates
- User engagement
- Storage usage

### Maintenance Plan
- Weekly security updates
- Monthly accessibility audits
- Quarterly user feedback sessions
- Annual architecture review

## 8. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Inappropriate content | High | Admin moderation queue, content filters |
| Data loss | High | Regular backups, database replication |
| Performance issues | Medium | CDN, caching, lazy loading |
| Accessibility barriers | High | Regular testing with users |
| Cost overruns | Medium | Usage monitoring, alerts |

## 9. Success Criteria

- 90% of users can submit content independently
- Admin review time < 24 hours
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Zero critical accessibility issues
- 99.9% uptime

## 10. Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up GitHub repository with initial structure
3. Create Railway project and configure environment
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule weekly progress reviews
