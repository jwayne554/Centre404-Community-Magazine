# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **full-stack Next.js application** for Centre404 Community Magazine - an accessible digital magazine platform that allows community members to contribute stories, artwork, and recordings, with an admin approval workflow and magazine publishing system.

**Tech Stack:**

- **State Management**: Zustand 5.0.8
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary (configured but optional)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt
- **Text-to-Speech**: Unreal Speech API with browser fallback

## Key Features

- **Multi-format Contributions**: Text, images, drawings, and audio recordings
  - **Audio Recording**: Browser-based MediaRecorder API (works offline, no external services required)
    - Records in WebM format
    - No speech-to-text (that was removed)

  - **Drawing Preview**: Full canvas preview of user-submitted artwork
  - **Modal View**: Detailed submission review with all media types

- **Magazine Publishing**: Create and publish magazines from approved submissions
  - **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice playback using Unreal Speech API with automatic browser fallback
  - **Audio Playback**: Listen to submitted audio recordings in published magazines
  - **TTS Caching**: Reduces API calls and improves performance

- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
  - High contrast mode support
  - Adjustable font sizes
  - Full keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader support with ARIA labels
  - Focus management throughout

- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all system changes for compliance
- **Role-based Access**: ADMIN, MODERATOR, and CONTRIBUTOR roles

## Architecture

**Full-stack Next.js Application:**
- **Frontend**: React Server Components + Client Components in `src/app/`
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints in `src/app/api/`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies
- **State Management**: Zustand stores in `src/stores/`
- **Services**: API abstraction layer in `src/services/`

```

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: >= 18.17.0
- **PostgreSQL**: 17+ (installed via Homebrew)
- **Database**: `community_magazine`

### Environment Variables
The app requires a `.env` or `.env.local` file with:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johnny@localhost:5432/community_magazine"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="test-jwt-secret"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="test-refresh-secret"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="15m"
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="Centre404 Community Magazine"
NODE_ENV="development"

# Text-to-Speech (Unreal Speech)
UNREAL_SPEECH_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PREMIUM_TTS="true"  # Set to "false" to use browser fallback only
```

**IMPORTANT**: Due to a Next.js workspace root inference issue with multiple lockfiles, the DATABASE_URL must be explicitly set when starting the dev server.

### Starting the Development Server

**Option 1: Use the startup script (Recommended)**
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual start with explicit DATABASE_URL**
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johnny@localhost:5432/community_magazine" npm run dev
```

### Database Commands
```bash
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes to database
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with sample data
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npm run db:generate  # Regenerate Prisma client
```

### Test Credentials
- **Admin**: admin@test.com / password123
- **Sample Data**: 4 submissions (3 approved, 1 pending)

## Development Guidelines

When modifying this application:

1. **Accessibility First**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. All features must support:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen readers (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
   - High contrast mode
   - Adjustable font sizes
   - Focus management

2. **Database Changes**:
   - Always update `prisma/schema.prisma` first
   - Run `npm run db:push` to apply changes
   - Update TypeScript types if needed
   - Maintain audit logging for sensitive operations

3. **API Routes**:
   - Follow RESTful conventions
   - Use Zod for input validation
   - Return consistent error responses
   - Include proper authentication checks
   - Log important operations to AuditLog

4. **Authentication**:
   - JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
   - Refresh token rotation implemented
   - Role-based access control (ADMIN, MODERATOR, CONTRIBUTOR)
   - See `src/lib/auth.ts` and `src/middleware.ts`

5. **State Management**:
   - Use Zustand stores for client-side state
   - Server components for data fetching
   - Minimize client-side JavaScript

6. **Environment Setup**:
   - PostgreSQL service must be running (`brew services start postgresql@17`)
   - DATABASE_URL must be explicitly set (use `start-dev.sh`)
   - Environment variables loaded from `.env.local` and `.env`

## Important Notes

- **Original HTML Version**: The original single-file HTML prototype is preserved as `Centre404 Digital Magazine Remix.html` for reference
- **Multiple Lockfiles Warning**: Next.js detects multiple lockfiles (`/Users/johnny/bun.lock` and project `package-lock.json`). This is a known issue and doesn't affect functionality.
- **Database URL Issue**: Next.js may not load DATABASE_URL correctly from `.env` files due to workspace root inference. Always use `start-dev.sh` or set DATABASE_URL explicitly.
- **Health Check**: Visit `/api/health` to verify database connectivity and app status
- **Hot Reload**: Works for most changes, but Prisma client changes require server restart
- **Audio Recording**: Uses browser MediaRecorder API (works offline). Microphone permission required. Saves recordings as WebM format.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Unreal Speech API provides natural voices. Automatically falls back to browser Web Speech API if API key is missing or quota exceeded. No internet required for fallback.

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Next.js 15 Build Issue
- **Issue**: Static page generation fails during build with `<Html>` import error on `/404` and `/500` pages
- **Root Cause**: Internal Next.js 15.5.2 bug with App Router error page generation
- **Impact**: Local builds fail, but Railway deployments may succeed due to different build environment
- **Workarounds Applied**:
  - `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true` in `next.config.ts` (temporary)
  - `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` in root layout
  - Placeholder DATABASE_URL in Dockerfile build stage
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Next.js 16+ (see Optimization section below)

### Package Updates Needed
Current versions are outdated. See "Optimization Opportunities" section for update plan.

## Optimization Opportunities

### Priority 1: Safe Updates (Recommended First)
```bash
npm update @prisma/client prisma zod axios react-hook-form tailwindcss
npm update @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```
Expected benefit: Security patches, bug fixes (minimal risk)

### Priority 2: Framework Updates
```bash
npm install react@19.2.0 react-dom@19.2.0
npm install next@16.0.1 eslint-config-next@16.0.1
```
Expected benefit: Fixes `<Html>` build error, performance improvements, new features
Risk: Medium (breaking changes in Next.js 16)

### Priority 3: Infrastructure
- **Dockerfile**: Upgrade from Node 18 → Node 22 Alpine
- **Build caching**: Implement better layer caching
- **Image size**: Currently 89MB, can reduce to ~40MB with standalone output optimization
- **Remove `--legacy-peer-deps`**: After package updates

### Expected Improvements
After all optimizations:
- ✅ 30-40% faster build times
- ✅ 40-50% smaller Docker images
- ✅ 10-15% runtime performance improvement
- ✅ Fixes Next.js 15 build errors
- ✅ Latest security patches
